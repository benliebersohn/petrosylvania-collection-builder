            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            A flood event that has a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. (This term does not mean a flood that happens once a century. And it does not mean a flood that has a 1 percent chance of happening every year.)

            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            A 1.5-mile-long elevated freight track running through South Philadelphia, dividing the neighborhoods <a class="def-link" href="#Grays-Ferry">Grays Ferry</a> (on its west) from <a class="def-link" href="#Point-Breeze">Point Breeze</a> and West Passyunk (on its east). It was finished in 1928 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, complete with loading bays, in anticipation of a new corridor of factories. Instead came the Great Depression, WWII, and postwar deindustrialization. By the late twentieth century, the viaduct had become an unsightly and dangerous relic that regularly shed debris onto the street below. Auto repair shops became the main businesses in the shadow of squat Ionic columns made of steel-reinforced concrete. Now owned by CSX, the 25th Street Viaduct is still in use. In the 2010s, trains carrying crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken formation regularly rolled through Philadelphia over this line.

            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            A short name for a package of laws passed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1995 to encourage voluntary cleanup and reuse of <a class="def-link" href="#brownfields">brownfields</a> and other contaminated commercial and industrial sites. Also known as the “Land Recycling Program,” Act 2 established standards for environmental review and remediation, and processes for liability relief and financial assistance. The program is administered by the <a class="def-link" href="#DEP">DEP</a>.

        <h3 id="Areas-of-Interest">Area(s) of Interest (AOI)</h3>
            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            In 2003, Sunoco entered into a new consent order and agreement with the <a class="def-link" href="#DEP">DEP</a> to investigate and remediate legacy pollution at its <a class="def-link" href="#South_Philadelphia-refinery-complex">South Philadelphia refinery complex</a>. For administrative purposes, Sunoco divided the complex into eleven Areas of Interest (AOI), ten aboveground, one underground. Responsibility for pre-2012 pollution, including subsurface contamination, still belongs to Sunoco (and its parent company, Energy Transfer), even though the refinery complex has since changed ownership, twice, and the facility has been demolished. The northern portion of AOI-1, the <a class="def-link" href="#Belmont-Terminal">Belmont Terminal</a>, is now treated as a separate remediation unit. Areas of Interest 1–4 comprise the “south yard” of the historic Atlantic/ARCO refinery at <a class="def-link" href="#Point-Breeze">Point Breeze</a>, with AOI-8 being the “north yard” and AOI-10 being the “west yard.” Areas 5, 6, 7, and 9 comprise the historic Gulf (later Chevron) refinery at <a class="def-link" href="#Girard-Point">Girard Point</a>. AOI-9 is also known as the <a class="def-link" href="#Schuylkill-River-Tank_Farm">Schuylkill River Tank Farm</a>. A Sunoco subsidiary, <a class="def-link" href="#Evergreen">Evergreen Resources Group, LLC,</a> has managed cleanup of the AOIs since 2013. Evergreen and its consultants have generated significant public documentation about each site within the former refinery complex. Most of these environmental remediation reports are browsable and downloadable on this website.

            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            A corporate place name that can refer to any of the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>A foundational facility under the ownership of Atlantic Petroleum Storage Company (Warden, Frew & Co.) that began distilling petroleum in 1870 at <a class="def-link" href="#Point-Breeze">Point Breeze</a> on the Schuylkill River, immediately south of the <a class="def-link" href="#Passyunk-Avenue-gas-works">Passyunk Avenue gas works</a>. The location is today’s <a class="def-link" href="#Areas-of-Interest">Area of Interest</a> 2.</li>
                    <li>A refinery in two parcels (the original “south yard,” or Areas of Interest 1–4, and the subsequent “north yard,” or Area of Interest 8) operated by Atlantic Refining under the control of the Standard Oil trust (personified by John D. Rockefeller) from 1874–1911. The “north yard” was also called the “Philadelphia yard” because it originated as a separate business concern of the Philadelphia Refining Company before being purchased by Rockefeller.</li>
                    <li>That two-parcel refinery as owned by Atlantic Refining—and its corporate successor, Atlantic-Richfield (ARCO)—as a newly independent corporation after the federal dissolution of the Standard Oil trust in 1911. Atlantic/ARCO operated the refinery at Point Breeze until 1985.</li>
                    <li>That legacy refinery in the period 1985–1988, when it was owned by Dutch oil trader John Deuss through a company called Atlantic Petroleum Corporation.</li>
                    <li>That legacy refinery in the period 1988–1994, when Sun Company (later Sunoco) owned and operated it, but before Sun purchased the neighboring refinery at <a class="def-link" href="#Girard-Point">Girard Point</a> and integrated their operations to form one <a class="def-link" href="#South-Philadelphia-refinery-complex">South Philadelphia refinery complex</a>.</li>

        <h3 id="Bartrams-Garden">Bartram’s Garden</h3>
            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            A public park near <a class="def-link" href="#Kingsessing">Kingsessing</a> on the site where John Bartram (1699–1777), prominent Quaker and co-founder of the American Philosophical Society, established the first botanic garden in what would become the United States. Railroad engineer Andrew McCalla Eastwick (1811–1879) purchased Bartram’s plant collection for his country estate. The City of Philadelphia assumed ownership of the property in 1891. By that point, the green space was an orphan, surrounded on all sides by polluting industries and polluted sites. Bartram’s Garden was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Today (2025), a new swing bridge on the Schuylkill Banks trail promises to better connect the park (and <a class="def-link" href="#Southwest-Philadelphia">Southwest Philadelphia</a> more generally) to <a class="def-link" href="#Center-City">Center City</a>.
            </div>

        <h3 id="Bartrams-North">Bartram’s North</h3>
            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            A complex of <a class="def-link" href="#brownfields">brownfields</a> between Grays Avenue and the Schuylkill River between 49th Street and 51st Street, just upstream from <a class="def-link" href="#Bartrams-Garden">Bartram’s Garden</a>. As of 2025, some of the “Bartram’s North” property is owned by the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development (PAID). The land here has been eyed for redevelopment since at least 2013, when the City of Philadelphia published the Lower Schuylkill Master Plan. Bartram’s North still has legacy pollution from a number of former on-site industries: oil storage, paint production, garbage reduction, and waste incineration. The site also attracted illegal dumping in its period of post-industrial abandonment. The so-called “51st Street Terminal” was operated between 1951 and 2021 by various petroleum companies, including Allied Oil, Hess Oil, Plains Products Terminals, and PBF Logistics. Separately, Getty Oil had a tank farm near the “49th Street Terminal.” The brownfields here are not to be confused with “Bartram’s South” at <a class="def-link" href="#Gibson-Point">Gibson Point</a>, though the Bartram’s Mile section of the <a class="def-link" href="#Schuylkill-Banks">Schuylkill Banks</a> trail passes by both. A leak of chromium, a toxic substance, was discovered on the trail in July 2024, which led to investigation and remediation plans for the 51st Street Terminal.

        <h3 id="Belmont-Terminal">Belmont Terminal</h3>
            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            The Belmont Terminal, located at Passyunk Avenue and 28th Street, is a former distribution facility within the <a class="def-link" href="#South-Philadelphia-refinery-complex">South Philadelphia refinery complex</a> where fuel delivery trucks loaded gasoline and diesel to supply service stations in Greater Philadelphia. The property was not included in <a class="def-link" href="#HRP">HRP</a>’s 2020 purchase of the South Philadelphia refinery complex. It is still owned by Sunoco (though its parent company, Energy Transfer). Formerly designated within <a class="def-link" href="#Areas-of-Interest">Area of Interest</a> 1, the Belmont Terminal is now treated as a separate (non-numbered) remediation area.

            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            The commercial name of the ongoing redevelopment project (2020–) at the former <a class="def-link" href="#South-Philadelphia-refinery-complex">South Philadelphia refinery complex</a>, as branded by the current owner, <a class="def-link" href="#HRP">HRP</a>. According to HRP’s promotional material, the property is being designed and built for e-commerce, logistics, and life sciences. The surface area of the Bellwether District is nearly equivalent to that of the <a class="def-link" href="#Center-City">Center City</a> core commercial district.

        <h3 id="brownfields">brownfield(s)</h3>
            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            Former industrial or commercial site(s) where future use is affected by real and/or perceived environmental contamination. In 1988, the United States Conference of Mayors began publishing an annual report, <i>Recycling America’s Land: A National Report on Brownfields Redevelopment</i>. In 1993, the <a class="def-link" href="#EPA">EPA</a> began issuing grants to local governments to launch pilot projects for remediating brownfields. In 2002, the US Congress passed (and George W. Bush signed) the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, which codified the approach of incentivizing cleanup of urban brownfields rather than punishing past polluters. In the United States, local and/or state agencies oversee the remediation of brownfields, whereas federal agencies oversee the remediation of more severely contaminated sites on the Superfund National Priorities List. The <a class="def-link" href="#Lowermost-Schuylkill-River">Lowermost Schuylkill River</a> petrochemical corridor contains many brownfields, but no Superfund sites.

                    <li>Contemporary downtown Philadelphia, including the main commercial and historical neighborhoods, which largely conforms to the original area of the city. The eastern and western boundaries—the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers—are obvious; the southern boundary is aptly named South Street. The current northern boundary, depending on one’s point of view, is Spring Garden Street or the sunken Vine Street Expressway.</li>
                    <li>Center City District: the area zoned as “Center City Core Commercial Mixed-Use” and the non-profit organization that works with the Central Philadelphia Development Corporation to enhance the vitality of downtown.</li>

It supplemented and ultimately replaced the Schuylkill Arsenal (founded in 1799) at 2620 Grays Ferry Road. Throughout its long history, the arsenal/depot made textiles for the military, including uniforms and flags.

Various names, including “The Meadows” and the “Far Southwest” have been applied to this low-lying section of the county. The name “Eastwick” (after a former owner of <a class="def-link" href="#Bartrams-Garden">Bartram's Garden</a>) dates to the 1920s, when developers and allied residents lobbied for improved city services through the Greater Eastwick Neighborhood Association. The name became fixed in the 1950s as part of the Eastwick Redevelopment Area Plan by the Philadelphia Planning Commission, which sought to “renew” this semi-marshy, semi-rural, semi-industrial and largely impoverished neighborhood. Flooding is a perennial problem in Eastwick—a problem expected to worsen with global warming.

        <h3 id="environmental-justice">environmental justice (EJ)</h3>
            <div class="container my-4 mx-2 border-start">
            A political movement and regulatory practice that emphasizes fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people—regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, area of residence, income, disability, educational level, etc.—in regard to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental law. The primary goal of EJ is to prevent any group of people from suffering disproportionate negative effects (including risks) relating to environmental health. In the United States, EJ grew out of the Black civil rights movement. In the 1980s, sociologist Robert D. Bullard published foundational research. Outside academia, a landmark 1987 report from the United Church of Christ (UCC), “Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States,” identified examples of “environmental racism.” The UCC’s Racial Justice Commission went on the sponsor the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991. The decade of the 1990s was a high point for EJ, with President Bill Clinton writing its principles into federal administrative guidelines, and with activists in postcolonial settings around the world adapting and expanding the movement. In the US, however, EJ became increasingly partisan in the first quarter of the twenty-first century, with deep political disagreements over the meaning and proper focus of equity: A) a historically informed effort to repair past and ongoing environmental injustices to disadvantaged groups and vulnerable populations (“<a class="def-link" href="#fenceline-communities">fenceline communities</a>”), or B) a future-oriented effort to deliver environmental goods to all people? In 2025, the second administration of Donald J. Trump revoked executive orders, regulatory guidelines, grants, and research funding relating to racial equity and environmental justice, portraying those concepts as discriminatory.

            A place name for the west bank of the Schuylkill River at the bend just downstream of <a class="def-link" href="#Bartrams-Garden">Bartram's Garden</a>. In the late nineteenth century, the US government paid for deep-water dredging from the mouth of the Schuylkill to “Gibson’s Point,” a distance of four miles. A collection of small, independent petroleum refineries arose here in the 1870s. In 1883, National Transit Company, a Standard Oil subsidiary, completed a 260-mile-long six-inch wrought-iron pipeline from an oil field near Colegrove, Pennsylvania, to Gibson Point, and thence under the river to the <a class="def-link" href="#Atlantic-refinery">Atlantic refinery</a> at Point Breeze. In 1888, Standard (John D. Rockefeller) acquired the oil works at Gibson Point, too. In 1929, United States Gypsum Corporation opened a manufacturing plant at Gibson Point, and in 1942 Socony-Vacuum added a tank farm at 58th Street and Schuylkill River. TransMontaigne later operated an oil terminal here. United States Gypsum closed in 1988, selling its property to a cement company. As of 2025, most of the post-petroleum <a class="def-link" href="#brownfields">brownfield</a> at Gibson Point is owned by the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development (PAID), which calls the property “Bartram’s South.” Not to be confused with <a class="def-link" href="#Bartrams-North">Bartram's North</a>, though the Bartram’s Mile section of the <a class="def-link" href="#Schuylkill-Banks">Schuylkill Banks</a> trail passes by both.

            In context of this website, this term applies to any fossil fuel (coal, petroleum, natural gas) or derivative therefrom, including <a class="def-link" href="#LNAPL">LNAPL</a>, liquid fuels, chemicals, and plastics. Under distillation, petroleum separates into different fractions of hydrocarbons, each with a different boiling point. These range from light fractions such as propane, butane, gasoline, and naphtha; middle distillates such as kerosene, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil; and heavy fractions such as lubricating oil, heavy fuel oil, paraffin wax, and bitumen. At the molecular level, all fossil fuels share commonalities. For example, methane (a gas) can be derived from coal (a solid). That is why coal was the historic source for municipal gas for streetlamps in Philadelphia and many other cities. For a time, <a class="def-link" href="#PGW">PGW</a> enriched its manufactured coal-gas with naphtha, a petroleum distillate, from the <a class="def-link" href="#Atlantic-refinery">Atlantic refinery</a>.

The original purpose of the utility was to create gas from coal to illuminate streetlamps. Using coal-gas as a consumer fuel for residential heating and cooking did not become common until the early twentieth century. After WWII, by which point gaslights were being phased out, PGW transitioned to natural gas. Today, Philadelphia is the largest city in the United States that controls a fossil fuel utility.

            In context of this website, this word means either of two things:
                <ol>
                    <li>Corporate branding related to the idea of “sustainable development”—that is, the assertion that capitalistic growth can meet present-day societal needs and preferences without jeopardizing the biosphere and future generations who will rely on it. For example, <a class="def-link" href="#HRP">HRP</a> presents its redevelopment plans for the <a class="def-link" href="#Bellwether-District">Bellwether District</a> as a “global model of sustainable development and design.”</li>
                    <li>Corporate or municipal protocols for promoting quality of life while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the early twenty-first century, it became standard institutional practice for an “office of sustainability” to create a “climate action plan” for meeting the parent institution’s decarbonization goal. The City of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) separately released their first climate action plans in 2009. The City is unlikely to meet its goal (“carbon neutrality” or “net zero” by 2050) without decarbonizing the operations of <a class="def-link" href="#PGW">PGW</a>. Many reports generated Philadelphia’s Office of Sustainability and by Penn Sustainability are browsable and downloadable through this website.</li>
                </ol>

            Also called Tasker Street Housing Project. One of the earliest (1937) high-density projects by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, it occupied 40 acres near 30th Street and Tasker Street in <a class="def-link" href="#Grays-Ferry">Grays Ferry</a>, close to the north yard of the <a class="def-link" href="#Atlantic-refinery">Atlantic refinery</a>. On at least two occasions—May 1970 and August 1983—residents of Tasker Homes had to be evacuated due to refinery accidents. In 2004, Tasker Homes was demolished to make way for low-density public housing, renamed Grays Ferry Estates.
