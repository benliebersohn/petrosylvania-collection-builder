This tool allows you to see when and where 188 known petrochemical accidents occurred along the lower Schuylkill River, as superimposed on a current map. The date range is 1866 to 2019. Each dot represents one accident. The color red indicates fatal; orange indicates injurious; and blue indicates non-injurious. Zoom in until you can distinguish individual dots, then click on any one to see associated information.

<p>(Users with data visualization skills may wish to create their own maps or infographics using underlying data. <a href="browse.html#data%20sheet">Browse the genre tag "data sheets"</a> for a pair of spreadsheets—one listing injurious accidents and another listing total accidents. A third sheet with data on accident victims is available to professional researchers on request.)</p>
