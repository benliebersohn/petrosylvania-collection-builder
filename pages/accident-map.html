The Accidents Map allows you to see when and where 188 known petrochemical accidents occurred along the lower Schuylkill River, as superimposed on a current map. The date range is 1866 to 2019. Each dot or diamond represents one accident. Diamonds indicate nearly exact locations, whereas dots indicate approximate locations. <span style="background-color: rgb(255 0 0 /80%);">Red</span> indicates fatal; <span style="background-color: rgb(255 120 0 /80%);">orange</span> indicates injurious; and <span style="background-color: #3388ffcc;">blue</span> indicates non-injurious. Zoom in until you can distinguish individual accidents, then click on any dot or diamond to see associated information. Be aware that this map is optimized for computer screens, not mobile screens.

A third sheet with data on accident victims is available to professional researchers on request.)</p>
