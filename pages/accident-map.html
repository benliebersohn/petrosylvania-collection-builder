<h2>Accident Mapper</h2>

This interactive tool allows you to see where and when more than 160 reported petrochemical accidents occurred. Some sites within the refinery zone had multiple accidents over time, as indicated by a number. Zoom in on a number until it disaggregates into individual accidents.  (Users with data visualization skills may wish to create their own maps or infographics using the underlying data sheets, one of which provides names and addresses of accidents victims. [Browse under the genre tag “data sheets.”](/browse.html#data))
