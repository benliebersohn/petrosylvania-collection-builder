The Accidents Map allows you to see when and where 188 known petrochemical accidents occurred along the lower Schuylkill River, as superimposed on a current map. The date range is 1866 to 2019. Each dot represents one accident. Red indicates fatal; orange indicates injurious; and blue indicates non-injurious. Zoom in until you can distinguish individual dots, then click on any one to see associated information. Some dots have exact coordinates, but many others indicate approximate locations. Also be aware that this map is optimized for computer screens, not mobile screens.

<p>(Users with data visualization skills may wish to create their own maps or infographics using underlying data. <a href="browse.html#data%20sheet">Browse the genre tag "data sheets"</a> for a pair of spreadsheets—one listing injurious accidents and another listing total accidents. A third sheet with data on accident victims is available to professional researchers on request.)</p>
