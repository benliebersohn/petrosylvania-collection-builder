This project originated in 2020, the year the South Philadelphia Refinery Complex permanently closed, and the year when principal investigator Jared Farmer moved to Philadelphia to join the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn, Farmer began teaching courses on Pennsylvania fossil fuel history and began doing collaborative research with students. Over time, the primary output of Farmer’s “Petrosylvania” project came into focus: A freely accessible public-facing website for collecting and curating historical sources about the lower Schuylkill River petrochemical corridor, and for sharing scholarship that synthesize that information. With technical help from Penn Libraries, Farmer launched this website in 2025, in advance of the US Semiquincentennial (250th anniversary) in Philadelphia.

<h1>How to use this site</h1>

There are any number of ways to use this site—no right or wrong way. That being said, it is recommended that you begin by reading the executive summary, <a href="reference.html#summary">"Reckoning with Fossil Fuel in Philadelphia,”</a> located under the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> tab. The executive summary includes a detailed timeline of the petrochemical corridor.

After that, consider these pathways:

<div class="container my-4 mx-4">
    <h2>Reference articles</h2>
        <p>Read one or more of the six encyclopedia-style articles, which range in length from 7,500 to 20,000 words. Each of these articles (under the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> tab) includes a bibliography. Readers lacking background in fossil fuel history should begin with the two shortest articles: <a href="reference.html#penna-coal">“Pennsylvania Coal and Philadelphia”</a> and <a href="reference.html#petro-industry">“Petroleum Industry and Greater Philadelphia.”</a> Others may refer to go straight to the longest article: <a href="reference.html#south-philly-refinery">“South Philadelphia Refinery Complex.”</a> All the reference works can be downloaded.</p>
    <h2>Historic images</h2>
        <p>Browse ~200 downloadable images, grouped into five collection types: 1) architectural, 2) low-angle views, 3) aerial photography, 4) newspaper headlines, and 5) news photography. You can also search for images using geographic or descriptive keywords that you encounter in the reference works. For example: ARCO, Atlantic Refining, bridge, DuPont, Center City, explosion, expressway, fire, firefighters, Gibson Point, Girard Point, Grays Ferry, Gulf, incinerator, north yard, Passyunk Avenue, PGW, pollution, Quartermaster Depot, Point Breeze, Schuylkill River, storage tank, tanker ship, Tasker Homes, Yankee Point, and so on.</p>
    <h2>Explore collections</h2>
        Browse ~400 downloadable items of grey literature, grouped into sixteen collection types:

    <h2>Targeted searching</h2>
        <p>Use the website’s search bar for targeted searching by keyword, personal name, place name, year, etc. This will work for texts as well as images.</p>
    <h2>Chronological browsing</h2>
        <p>Browse all the items, both texts and images, chronologically.</p>
    <h2>Lesson plans</h2>
        <p>Read the <a href="lessons.html">lesson plans</a>, which have been designed for social studies teachers at the middle and high school levels in Greater Philadelphia. The curriculum may also be of interest to college educators anywhere who offer courses on energy history, energy policy, environmental justice, labor history, urban environmental history, city planning, or the built environment. The lesson plan could also could be pertinent, in a comparative way, for residents, activists, and planners in other urban zones with legacy refineries (e.g., Linden, New Jersey; Brooklyn, New York; and Richmond, California).</p>
    <h2>Interactive maps</h2>
        <p>Explore the two mapping tools:</p>
        <div class="container my-4 mx-4">
        <li><a href="layered-map.html">Historic maps</a> consists maps, planar (top-down) aerial photographs, and satellite images. The date range goes from 1876, the year of the US centennial, to 2019, the year the refinery exploded for the last time. All these cartographic scans have been georeferenced and georectified (pinned and aligned) so they can be layered for visual comparison. By layering and unlayering, and by zooming in and zooming out, you can see how the built environment has changed over time. These layered maps have inherent visual interest, but you will gain more from them as you learn about Philadelphia and its fossil fuel history from the textual side of the website. Atop any layer, you can superimpose the boundaries of the ten “Areas of Interest” (environmental remediation zones) that comprise the former PES Refinery.</li>
        <li><a href="accident-map.html">Accident mapper</a> allows you to see where and when 186 known petrochemical accidents occurred, as superimposed on a current map. The date range is 1866 to 2019. Each dot in red designates a fatal accident, whereas orange indicates injurious and blue indicates non-injurious. Zoom in until you can see individual dots, then click on any one to see associated information. (Users with data visualization skills may wish to create their own maps or infographics using underlying data. <a href="browse.html#data%20sheet">Browse the genre tag "data sheets"</a> for a pair of sheets — one listing injurious accidents and another listing total accidents. A third sheet with data on accident victims is available to professional researchers on request.)</li>

For visualizing environmental justice data about Philadelphia, three mapping tools are useful: Drexel University’s <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7f9fe422b91d4740b93d587ae17dad38" target="_blank">Green Living Plan for Philadelphia</a>, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://gis.dep.pa.gov/PennEnviroScreen/" target="_blank">PennEnviroScreen</a>, and Public Environmental Data Partners’ reconstruction of the EPA’s <a href="https://screening-tools.com/epa-ejscreen" target="_blank">EJScreen</a> (discontinued by the White House in February 2025).

One large class of primary sources crucial to the "Petrosylvania" project cannot be included here: proprietary scans from ProQuest Historical Newspapers and Newspapers.com. Serious researchers may want to use such subscription services to supplement this website.

Much of the information on this website was compiled by student research assistants from newspaper accounts. Journalists, past and present, are known to make mistakes—and researchers are fallible, too. It is inevitable, despite fact-checking, that a certain number of errors persist. Readers are encouraged to do follow-up research. Indeed, this public-facing digital history project has been designed to aid just that.

The deepest purpose of “Petrosylvania” is to inspire and facilitate scholarship, storytelling, and sharing. Many important stories about America’s first petrochemical corridor remain to be told.
