<h2>Historic Maps</h2>

This research tool includes a variety of maps, planar (top-down) aerial photographs, and satellite images. The date range goes from 1876, the year of the US centennial, to 2019, the year the refinery exploded for the last time. All these cartographic scans have been georeferenced and georectified (pinned and aligned) so they can be layered for visual comparison. By layering and unlayering, and by zooming in and zooming out, you can see how the built environment has changed over time. These layered maps have inherent visual interest, but you will gain more from them as you learn about Philadelphia and its fossil fuel history from the textual side of the website. Atop any layer, you can superimpose the boundaries of the ten “Areas of Interest” (environmental remediation zones) that comprise the former PES Refinery.
