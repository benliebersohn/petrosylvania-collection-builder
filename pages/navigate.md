## How to Use This Site

There are any number of ways to use this site—no right or wrong way. That being said, it is recommended that you begin by reading the executive summary, [“Reckoning with Fossil Fuel in Philadelphia,”](/reference.html#summary) located under the [Reference](/reference.html) tab. The executive summary includes a detailed timeline of the petrochemical corridor.

After that, consider these pathways:

- ### Reference articles
Read one or more of the six encyclopedia-style articles, which range in length from 7,500 to 20,000 words. Each of these articles (under the [Reference](/reference.html) tab) includes a bibliography. Readers lacking background in fossil fuel history should begin with the two shortest articles: “Pennsylvania Coal and Philadelphia” and “The Petroleum Industry and Greater Philadelphia.” Others may prefer to go straight to the longest article: [“The South Philadelphia Refinery Complex.”](/reference.html#south-philly-refinery) All the reference works can be downloaded.

- ### Historic images
Browse the 350+ historic images, which include 1) architectural views and plans, 2) street-level and river views, 3) oblique aerial photography, and 4) newspaper headlines. These images can be keyword-limited by visual elements (e.g., “bridge,” “explosion,” “fire truck”). The images can also be keyword-limited by topographic, geographic, and/or corporate location (e.g., “Point Breeze (topographical),” “Point Breeze (neighborhood),” “Point Breeze Avenue Bridge,” or “PGW at Point Breeze”). All the images can be downloaded.

- ### Explore collections

- ### Targeted searching
Use the website’s search bar for targeted searching by keyword, personal name, place name, year, and so on.

- ### Lesson plan
Read the [lesson plan](/lesson.html), which has been designed for social studies teachers at the middle and high school levels in Greater Philadelphia. The curriculum may also be of interest to college educators anywhere who offer courses on energy history, energy policy, environmental justice, labor history, urban environmental history, city planning, or the built environment. The lesson plan could also could be pertinent, in a comparative way, for residents, activists, and planners in other urban zones with legacy refineries (e.g., Richmond, California, on San Francisco Bay).

- ### Interactive maps
Explore the two mapping tools: 

    - [“Historic maps”](/map.html#layered) consists maps, planar (top-down) aerial photographs, and satellite images. The date range goes from 1876, the year of the US centennial, to 2019, the year the refinery exploded for the last time. All these cartographic scans have been georeferenced and georectified (pinned and aligned) so they can be layered for visual comparison. By layering and unlayering, and by zooming in and zooming out, you can see how the built environment has changed over time. These layered maps have inherent visual interest, but you will gain more from them as you learn about Philadelphia and its fossil fuel history from the textual side of the website. Atop any layer, you can superimpose the boundaries of the ten “Areas of Interest” (environmental remediation zones) that comprise the former PES Refinery. 

    - [“Accident mapper”](/map.html#accident-map) allows you to see where and when 160 reported petrochemical accidents occurred. Certain sites within the refinery zone had multiple accidents over time, as indicated by a number. Zoom in on a number until it disaggregates into individual accidents. (Users with data visualization skills may wish to create their own maps or infographics using the underlying data sheets, one of which provides names and addresses of accidents victims. [Browse under the genre tag “data sheets.”](/browse.html#data))
