description: "This educational website provides Philadelphians—and others who care about the past and future of this city—an unsurpassed collection of sources about the South Philadelphia Refinery Complex and other petrochemical landscapes along the lower Schuylkill River. Fundamentally, this website is a digital archive accompanied by reference works. Stakeholders at all levels—neighborhood, municipal, Commonwealth, business, non-profit—will find information of interest among the encyclopedia articles, primary sources (historic maps, images, documents), grey literature, and data sheets curated here. Whether you are a student, teacher, researcher, planner, developer, activist, journalist, or infrastructure geek, you are invited to use this website to learn, share, and create content about the fossil fuel legacies in Philadelphia’s built environment."
