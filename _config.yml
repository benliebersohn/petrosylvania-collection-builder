Fundamentally, this website is a digital archive accompanied by reference works. Stakeholders at all levels—neighborhood, municipal, Commonwealth, business, non-profit—should find information of interest among the articles, primary sources (historic maps, images, documents), grey literature, and data sheets curated here. Whether you’re a student, teacher, researcher, planner, designer, real estate developer, neighborhood activist, environmental journalist, or infrastructure geek, you are invited to use this website to learn, to share, and to create content about fossil fuel legacies in Philadelphia."
